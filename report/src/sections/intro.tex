\section{Introduction}
This report focuses on building and evaluating a sentiment classification system using pretrained word embeddings. Our work is organized into three main parts:

In section 2, we prepare and analyze the word embeddings that form the foundation of our classification system. We use GloVe as our embedding method and address the out-of-vocabulary (OOV) issue through a novel greedy matching approach.

In section 3, we implement and evaluate a basic RNN model for sentiment classification. We explore different strategies for sentence representation and conduct extensive hyperparameter tuning to optimize model performance.

In the last section, we utilized different methods to improve classificat model and proposed our final method.

\paragraph{Note} Results may fluctuate due to variations in settings such as GPU type and other parameters. However, we ensure consistency within each set of ablations and experiments by maintaining identical settings throughout. Specific settings are provided for each experiment we conduct.
